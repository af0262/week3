MPCS 50101: Homework for Week 3
===============================

There are two challenges this week:

### 1. Blackjack Card Game

Watch the screencast: http://quietube7.com/v.php/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwjOS9-fMrc&feature=youtu.be  (or let me know you would like an .mp4 to watch offline).

Then open `blackjack.py` and try to build what you saw in the video.  Full game instructions are included in `blackjack.py`.

### 2. Divvy Bike Availabilty

Which Divvy station is closest to Young and how many bikes are available right now?  Your challenge is to write a program that will answer that question.  Your output should look something like this:

```
The nearest station is: Sheffield Ave & Kingsbury St
There are 4 bikes currently available.
```

(Of course, that station isn't the correct answer, that's what your program will have to solve).

Good luck and have fun!  Post a message to Piazza if you have any questions.
